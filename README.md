# DES encryption algorithm
The goal of this university project was not efficiency, readability and possibility to follow the process of DES algorithm.
It is written in modern C++. Mainly two features of modern C++ were utilized:
*	Bitsets – To allow easy bit manipulation and debug logging
*	Templated functions – To limit code duplicity
